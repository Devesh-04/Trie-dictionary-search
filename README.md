# üß† Trie-Based Dictionary Search with Fuzzy Matching

This project is a **C++ application** that implements an efficient dictionary search using a **Trie data structure**. It supports two powerful search capabilities:

- üîç **Prefix Matching (Autocomplete)**: Quickly finds all words that start with a given query.
- üß† **Fuzzy Matching (Spellcheck)**: Suggests closely related words based on edit (Levenshtein) distance, making it ideal for handling typos or misspellings.

The program loads a list of words from a file and builds a trie for fast and intelligent search.

## üìà Project Objective

To create a console-based dictionary search program that not only finds exact word matches but also intelligently suggests words based on **prefixes** and **spelling similarity** using a **Trie and dynamic programming (Levenshtein Distance)**.

This is similar to how search engines and modern editors provide autocomplete and autocorrect suggestions.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Load dictionary from a text file
- ‚úÖ Build a Trie structure for fast word storage and prefix retrieval
- ‚úÖ Prefix-based search (autocomplete)
- ‚úÖ Fuzzy search (typo correction) using Levenshtein Distance (edit distance ‚â§ 2)
- ‚úÖ Sort fuzzy matches based on how close they are (edit distance)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Project Works

### 1. **Loading the Dictionary**
All words are read from a file called `dictionary.txt`. Each word is inserted into a Trie data structure. Create a file named dictionary.txt in the same directory. Each line should contain a single word:

Example content of dictionary.txt:
apple
application
applet
banana
battle
bat

### 2. **Trie Insertion**
Each node in the Trie contains:
- A character
- A flag indicating whether the node is terminal (end of a valid word)
- A map of children nodes

### 3. **Prefix Search**
Given a query like `"app"`, we traverse the Trie to reach the last character of the prefix. From there, a DFS is run to collect all valid words starting with that prefix.

### 4. **Fuzzy Search**
We collect all words from the Trie using a DFS, and then compute **Levenshtein Distance** between the query and each word.
If the distance is ‚â§ 2, the word is added to the result.
The results are sorted by how close they are (lower distance = better match).
